MARKETING PLAYBOOK

We made this Advertising, Marketing, and Communications Playbook to provide steps and guidelines to ensure legal compliance for \[INSERT NAME OF COMPANY]("Company") communications content and strategies. This document is intended to be company-wide and implemented for any communications with anyone outside of the company, whether it be a social media post, a speaking engagement at a conference, or a personal conversation with a potential partner. 

For anyone publishing content and/or facing the general public, it is important to be careful what you say as to not inadvertently create issues for the Company. To clarify, statements about the Company may prove volatile for widespread adoption of the COMPANY platform or can create legal problems.  It is also important to remember that there may be laws or contracts that prohibit us from making certain representations or disclosures. Accordingly, anyone who wants to make public statements related to the Company and/or the Company’s business should follow the below policies and procedures. 
Policy.

## The overarching policy is simple:

- Do not, intentionally, negligently, or recklessly, make any false or misleading representations of fact or any such omissions; and

- ensure that definitive statements about the Company and/or its intentions are presented in the manner as approved by the Company executives. 

Although this may seem simple to understand and follow, it is often an area that is easily overlooked. Often is the case that a certain message is inconsistent with the facts due to information asymmetry, and a statement might be thought of as true when in fact it is not. 
For example, a team member may be speaking at a conference and when asked about the functionality of the product their answer deviates from other materials. This team member might be under the impression that the product may have certain features or functionality that are not available to the public yet.

Thus, the below procedures are in place to minimize information asymmetry and provide guidelines that will enable team members to operate a little more autonomously in making public statements.

## Prohibited Statements

As a general policy, the following statements are prohibited unless expressly approved by [INSERT RESPONSIBLE PARTY HERE]:
Do NOT make any representations regarding the value of the token.

Do NOT commit the company to any obligations, except as otherwise approved by the C-Suite. For example, do not make any representations that certain development milestones will absolutely be met by a certain date.

Do NOT make statements trashing or discussing the business of competitors.

## Procedures

Statements regarding information already publicly known that does not negatively impact the Company.

### Approval Needed by Department Heads

Factual statements regarding the intent of the Company, if not previously approved.

Statements that include peoples’ or companies’ names and/or relate to their business. Seek approval from the relevant department.
