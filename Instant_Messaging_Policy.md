REAL TIME MESSAGING GUIDELINES
Last updated: XX/XX/XXXX

These \[INSERT COMPANY NAME HERE] (“Company”) guidelines are for the use of any type of real-time messaging software including Discord/Telegram/Slack, and/or other types of approved real-time communication that enables sharing of information and opinion.  These guidelines apply to your use of Company real-time messaging software as well as any other third party servers or chatrooms where you may be representing the Company.   Following these guidelines will make us more consistent, efficient, and effective in our communications: 

## Basics.

Tone. We encourage you to remain professional in your tone.  If you wouldn’t say it to your mother, don’t say it in the chat.  When instant messaging, there are no facial expressions and voice tones to assist in determining the meaning or intent behind a certain comment. This leaves too much room for misinterpretation.  However, assume best intent when reading a message and give each other the benefit of doubt. 

Behavior. Think before posting.  Is this something I want everyone to see? Company employees are expected to use their best judgment, however, Company expects employees to conduct themselves professionally and respectfully in any Company environment. 

Security.  Two-factor authentication (2FA) provides an additional level of security to your account and must be enabled.  Do not automatically accept messages from people you do not know, and do not click on links without verifying their authenticity.  Where possible, turn off any auto-downloading content features.      

## Who is in the Chatroom?

Non-Employee Third Parties. We may sometimes have non-employee third parties, community members, contractors, or advisors that are present in our chatrooms.  We need to take special consideration when these parties are present in any discussion (whether they are active or not.) They do not operate with us on a day to day and can misconstrue conversations easily. Each topic that is brought to their attention is the opportunity to represent the Company. Please consider this when discussing anything with parties present. Topics that would be inappropriate include: Internal Issues, Complaints, and Highly Confidential Matters. Please see your immediate Supervisor or Department Head if you are unsure of what is considered inappropriate. 

Other Departments. To avoid inhibiting production of other departments, please only include other departments in discussions that are necessary and will assist with their production. We encourage collaboration as long as it is appropriate. 

Sub-groups.  Departments should have separated chat rooms when possible.  Use these groups or private DM’s for sensitive material or for coordinating.  

Time Zones - Real-time messaging is an easy and considerably faster way to communicate with colleagues. As most employees also work from their personal device off hours, they most likely have Slack (and any other approved work-related apps) downloaded to their phones. Please consider timezones when engaging with any individual or chat room via real-time messenger after hours, unless it is an absolute emergency. In other words do not spam an unresponsive coworker with messages.  

## Topics. 

Sensitivity. Discussing sensitive topics, unless authorized by your Department Head and with the appropriate parties, is not encouraged on real-time messenger. Once documented, we assume it can become public. Please be considerate of the matters you are discussing online, the devices you are discussing them on, and who you are discussing them with. Generally, we encourage using common sense in determining what is sensitive information. For example, if the discussion relates to a particular employee's performance, this information would be sensitive and should be handled through more appropriate channels.

Decision Making. If a decision is being requested via real-time messaging, ensure all appropriate personnel are present, and the decision is documented and communicated to all necessary persons. 

Conversation Tracking. Whatever the content, someone from each department should be assigned to track decisions, topics, and call to action items that are discussed via real-time messaging. This will ensure organization and accountability. 

## Slack Rules

Do not add anyone who is outside of your Department to a Department specific room without authorization from that Department Head
