## Purpose

The purpose of this policy is to ensure that all employees and anyone who is acting on behalf of _____(“Company”), including business partners and vendors, do not trade on any material nonpublic information (i.e. insider trading).  It is designed to ensure that people are aware of what trading on material nonpublic information  looks like and the potentially serious and costly legal consequences of violating it.

## Definition of Insider Trading

Insider trading occurs when a person uses material nonpublic information, that they gained through involvement with the Company, to make a decision to purchase, sell, or otherwise give away something.  This applies not only to trades, but also any tips or recommendations you may make to someone else based on your knowledge of this material nonpublic information. Below are some basic examples of insider trading of material nonpublic information. The fact that a potential example or fact pattern  is not described below does not mean that a problem does not exist.  

### Examples:

  1. You are responsible for managing the Company website.  You learn that the Company has just entered into a new partnership where the partner will be utilizing the company's token. No one outside of the company knows this yet.  You go to an exchange and acquire tokens of the Company in anticipation of the value going up. You also tell your friends and family to acquire the token.  

  2. You learn that the Company is going to be featuring the NFT collection of a certain artist.  No one outside of the company is aware of this, meaning it is non-public.  You acquire several of the artist's pieces on another NFT marketplace in anticipation of the value increasing. As with the example above, disclosure of the information to other individuals to utilize for their benefit would also be considered insider trading.  
 
  3. You are a DAO token holder and the DAO is considering merging with another protocol.  The information is nonpublic and not all members of the DAO have been notified.  In anticipation of the merger you frontrun the deal and acquire tokens at a lower price.  

  4. You have access to a paid feature on the public facing website of the Company.  The Company derives its revenue from selling subscriptions for this feature.  You sell access to your account to friends and pocket the money.  

While the above examples are not exhaustive, they are a good roadmap for understanding how the misuse of material nonpublic information can be insider trading.  Using confidential, material and nonpublic information about Company and its customers, suppliers, or competitors to achieve an unfair advantage -- or passing material information to anyone, including family members and friends, who may benefit from knowing and using material, nonpublic information for their personal gain -- is unethical and may be illegal.  

### Identification and Disclosure

The above examples of insider trading of material nonpublic information, share commonalities.  Specifically, the use of material nonpublic information for personal gain. It is important to remember though, that issues can also arise when passing along this information to someone else who is not privy to this information who would consider it important in arriving at a decision to buy, sell, or hold based on this non-public information.

The easiest way to avoid situations is for an individual to recuse themselves in situations where there could be the potential for the disclosure of material nonpublic information.  Anyone who represents the Company in any way should be familiar with this policy and ensure that anyone who they supervise should be aware of them as well. 

### Reporting and Accountability

Penalties for trading on or communicating material nonpublic information can be severe, both for the individual and for the Company.  Trading on inside information, or non-disclosure of other potential conflicts of interest, violates this policy and can expose you to potential civil and criminal liability. Becoming aware of violations of this policy and failing to report the violations could also be considered a violation of the policy.
