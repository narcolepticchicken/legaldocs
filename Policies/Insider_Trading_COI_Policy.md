## Purpose

The purpose of this policy is to ensure that all employees and anyone who is acting on behalf of _____(“Company”), including business partners and vendors, manage any actual, potential, or perceived conflicts of interest with the Company.  It is designed to ensure that people are aware of what a potential conflict of interest looks like, why it could make it difficult for them to perform their work objectively, and to avoid potentially serious and costly legal consequences.  

## Definition of Conflict of Interest

A conflict of interest occurs when the private interests of an individual interfere, or could be perceived to conflict, with the interests of the Company. Alternatively, a conflict of interest could be defined as utilizing proprietary, or otherwise non-public, information for their benefit.  Most of the examples of conflicts of interest focus on the use of non-public information to gain a competitive advantage in markets over the rest of the market participants (i.e. insider trading).  Below are some basic examples of conflicts of interest. The fact that a potential conflict or fact pattern  is not described below does not mean a conflict does not exist.  

### Examples:

  1. You are responsible for managing the Company website.  You learn that the Company has just entered into a new partnership where the partner will be utilizing the company's token. No one outside of the company knows this yet.  You go to an exchange and acquire tokens of the Company in anticipation of the value going up. You also tell your friends and family to acquire the token.  

  2. You learn that the Company is going to be featuring the NFT collection of a certain artist.  No one outside of the company is aware of this, meaning it is non-public.  You acquire several of the artist's pieces on another NFT marketplace in anticipation of the value increasing. As with the example above, disclosure of the information to other individuals to utilize for their benefit would also create a conflict.  
  
  3. You are a DAO token holder and the DAO is voting on a proposal to engage with a third party service provider.  You advocate for hiring a company that you have a direct financial interest in, and know that the proposal calls for fees well above the current market rate.  You do not disclose the conflict prior to advocating or voting on the proposal. 

  4. You have access to a paid feature on the public facing website of the Company.  The Company derives its revenue from selling subscriptions for this feature.  You sell access to your account to friends and pocket the money.  

While the above examples are not exhaustive, they are a good roadmap for understanding what a conflict of interest is.  Using confidential, material and nonpublic information about Company and its customers, suppliers, or competitors to achieve an unfair advantage -- or passing material information to anyone, including family members and friends, who may benefit from knowing and using material, nonpublic information for their personal gain -- is unethical and may be illegal.  These types of conflicts of interests  are also often referred to as insider trading. 


### Identification and Disclosure

The above examples of potential conflicts of interest, share commonalities.  Specifically, the use of material nonpublic information for personal gain. Conflicts  can also arise when passing along this information to someone else who is not privy to this information who would consider it important in arriving at a decision to buy, sell, or hold based on this non-public information.

The easiest way to avoid a potential conflict of interest is for an individual to recuse themselves in situations where there could be a potential or perceived conflict of interest.  Conflicts, however, are not always clear cut so any individual who becomes aware of a transaction or relationship that would reasonably be expected to give rise to a conflict of interest should discuss this matter promptly with their supervisor or a designated Compliance Officer.  

### Reporting and Accountability

Penalties for trading on or communicating material nonpublic information can be severe, both for the individual and for the Company.  Trading on inside information, or non-disclosure of other potential conflicts of interest, violates this policy and can expose you to potential civil and criminal liability. Becoming aware of violations of this policy and failing to report the violations could also be considered a violation of the policy.
